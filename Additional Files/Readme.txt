These are CGs to add in the RanceQuestCG.afa file.
If you dont fork from the initial commit to make your own thing and want the lastest changes in the repository,
you will find that the code does reference to images that do not exist in the base file. This is why
you will need to use the ALDExplorer2QuestEdition program to add them yourself.
